# Weed Strike Project Plan

This is the project plan for Weed Strike. This covers general planning thoughts in addition to tasks and milestones. This is NOT a design document for the game.

1. enter the avatar
  1. wall solidity (and initial map position)
    1. add attributes to tiles (walkable, solid, opaque, etc.)
    1. get a random walkable place on the map
    1. entities are put in a walkable location when added to the map
    1. entities can walk only on walkable tiles
    1. get a map entry location (a walkable space close to the perimeter)
    1. put avatar at that location to start the game
1. bug fix: render map after game load/restore
