# Weed Strike Project Plan

This is the project plan for Weed Strike. This covers general planning thoughts in addition to tasks and milestones. This is NOT a design document for the game.

1. enter the avatar
  1. wall solidity (and initial map position).
    1. get a map entry location (a walkable space close to the perimeter)
    1. put avatar at that location to start the game
