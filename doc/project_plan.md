# Weed Strike Project Plan

This is the project plan for Weed Strike. This covers general planning thoughts in addition to tasks and milestones. This is NOT a design document for the game.

1. basic persistence
  1. persistence mode (save, load, new)
  1. persist game state, which for now is just the main random number seed (though in the future each relevant section will have its own seed / RNG instance)
1. map
  1. map created and displayed
  1. move camera around map
  1. persist map and camera location
